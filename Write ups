Description
Whenever a registered userâ€™s email is entered in one of the sub domain of BookMyShow that is https://fanhood-returns.bookmyshow.com/, order ID is the expected result, but here when I intercepted the request and checked with the response, all the sensitive information was clearly displayed in the response section which included the PII that is  Name, Phone number, delivery address, mode of payment which was used while ordering, along with its confirmation page.

Steps to reproduce

1) Visit the URL, and enter registered email id. (in my case I ordered a Tshirt from fanhood using my registered email ID)
 2) According to the POC, I ordered a product from my account that is mahajan.akshay898@gmail.com, hence we observe my order ID
 3) Click on the order ID and intercept the request in burp suite.
 4) Send the intercepted request to repeater and go, if you observe the response all the Personally identifiable information is leaked.
5) For further exploitation I tried to find some more registered emails and found out test@bookmyshow.com, the outcome was the same for every other email, sensitive information was being leaked. 

Expected result
Only the order ID should be expected into the response and not the customers information.

Actual result
Entire order summary along with Personally Identifiable Information of the customer who has placed orders gets reflected into the response section.

POC 
Refer the video proof of concept demonstrating the vulnerability.
